Game Mechanics
<hr/>
Your goal is to destroy all the robot ships by activating mines and getting robot ships into their range.
<img class="helpImage" src="/images/mineExample.png" alt="Mine Radius Example">  Any asteroid or robot ship in the shown radius of an activated mine will be destroyed.
If a robot ship is next to an inactive mine, it will move onto it's space and destroy it, but it will target your ship over the mine.
If a robot ship gets to your ship, it will destroy it.
If you try and move your ship into an asteroid or into the red laser, you'll miss a turn.

Ending the game
<hr/>
There are 4 ways the game can end
    1.	All robot ships are destroyed
    2.	Your ship is destroyed
    3.	There are no more inactive mines of the board
    4.	The game is ended with the end button

Winning and losing
<hr/>
At the end of the game, there are three possible outcomes
	Win
	       If your ship survives, and all robot ships are destroyed, you win.
	Lose
	      If your ship survives, and all robot ships are destroyed, you lose.
	Draw
	    If your ship survives, but there are still surviving robot ships, or if neither your ship nor any robot ships survive, it's a draw.
